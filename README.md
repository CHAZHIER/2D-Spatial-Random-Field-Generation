# 2D Spatial Correlated Random Field Generation

This python notebook generates a spatial 2D correalted random field given mean velocity value, correlation of variation (by which standard deviation can be calculated), length scale in X (horizontal) and Z (vertical) directions, length of the domain and element size for stochastic mesh.
