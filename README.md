# 2D-Spatial-Random-Field-Generation

This python notebook generates a spatial 2D random field given mean velocity value, correlation of variation (by which standard deviation can be calculated), length scale in X (horizontal) and Z (vertical) directions, length of the domain and element size for stochastic mesh. The last two parameters will be replaced by FEM mesh once implemented into SeismoSSI.
